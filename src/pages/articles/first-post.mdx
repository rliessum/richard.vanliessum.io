This is my personal site and blog. I have plenty of interests. And this site gives me an outlet to experiment and share my findings on a specific `{topic}`, that might be of use to somebody else.
My topics list is not complete by any means, so updates are to be expected.

```python
topics = ["engineering", "programming", "design", "leadership", "sports"]

def topic(topics: list) -> str:
    random_topic = random.choice(topics)
    return random_topic

topic = topic(topics)
```
